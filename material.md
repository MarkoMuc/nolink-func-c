# Explanatory material

Each part corresponds to a part in the *How to execute object files* series.

## [Part 1](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-execute-an-object-file-part-1)

Compilation is a multi-stage process. First, the source code is compiled into machine code, which is saved in object files, afterwards, the linker assembles all object files into a single working program and binds references together. The output of a linker is an executable file.

Today, executables are also dynamically linked, which means all code is not present during compile time, instead, the code is "borrowed" during runtime from shared libraries.

Runtime linking is done by the OS, which invokes the dynamic loader. The dynamic loader finds the shared libraries, maps them to the process's address space, and resolves all dependencies our code has on them.

### Loading an object file into the process memory

First, create a `obj.c` file with simple functions and compile it into an object file with `gcc -c obj.c`.

Executing the object file is the same as using it as a library. Since we do not use dynamic linking, the dynamic loader will not load the object file for us, we must do this manually. The object file needs to be loaded into the RAM.

At this stage, the object file is simply mapped into memory. To do this, `mmap` is used, so the OS lazily reads the file when needed. Afterwards, we need to parse the object file, which is actually an ELF file.

### Parsing ELF files

Segments and sections are the main parts of an ELF file. Different sections contain different types of ELF data: executable code, constant data, global variables, etc. Segments don't contain any data, they give directions to the OS, so it correctly loads the sections into the RAM. They explain where to load the sections into the RAM and the access pattern.

Futhermore, object files do not contain any segments, since the ELF segments are generated by the linker, not the compiler.

`readelf --segments ` and `readelf --sections` can be used to read ELF files.

Short descriptions of various ELF sections:

- `.text`: contains the executable code. This section is the primary area of interest for us.
- `.data` and `.bss`: contains global and static local variables. The `.data` section contains variables with an initial value, `.bss` just reserves space for variables with no initial value.
- `.rodata`: contains constant data, mostly string and byte arrays. Can be missing if no strings are used.
- `.symtab`: information about the symbols in the object file, including external symbols if they are present.
- `.strtab` and `.shstrtab`: contains packed strings for the ELF file. These are strings describing the names of other ELF structures, like symbols from `.symtab` or section names. All strings are stored in one place, and their respective data structures just reference them as an offset in either `.strtab` or `.shstrtab`, instead of storing the full string locally.

### The `.symtab` section

Our functions are stored in the `.text` sections, but since the section is just a byte blob, we need to extract the locations of each function. To do this, we use the `.symtab` section. `readelf --symbols` can come in handy to read and visualize it.

The output of `readelf` command has various fields. The Ndx column tells us to which section the symbol belongs. The other important column is Value, which tells us the offset from the start of the containing section.

### Finding and executing a function

The plan to execute a function:

1. Find ELF sections table and `.shstrtab` section (to lookup sections in the section table).
2. Find the `.symtab` and `.strtab` (to lookup symbols by name in the symbols table) sections.
3. Find the `.text` section and copy it into the RAM with executable permissions.
4. Find function offsets in the symbol table.
5. Execute the functions.

In part 3 we need to copy the `.txt` section into RAM and add execute permissions. This is done for multiple reasons:

- Many CPUs don't allow or are slow at executing unaligned memory (4 kB for x86). The `.txt` section is not guaranteed to be page aligned.
- We may need to modify some bytes in the section to perform relocations.
- Each section needs to have its own permissions, and as such, each page in memory needs those permissions. This is why we need to relocate and align the memory. Therefore, we need to create new page-aligned memory ranges and copy the data there.
